The code performs time series forecasting on Walmart's footfalls data by preprocessing the dataset, extracting time features, and applying various regression models (Linear, Quadratic, Seasonality-based). Models are evaluated using RMSE, with the Quadratic model showing the best performance. Residuals from the best model are analyzed for autocorrelation using ACF and PACF, and an AutoRegressive (AR) model is applied to refine predictions. Final forecasts combine regression-based predictions with AR-based adjustments, yielding accurate future estimates.
